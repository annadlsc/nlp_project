# nlp_project

In this repository, you will find an EDA notebook for the ireland-news-headlines dataset.
In this notebook we will:
- load the data
- clean and preprocess it
- make some feature engineering
- analyze the labels distribution and understand if we need to reduce the dimension
- analyze the headline categories distributions
- explore the general headline categories (as the categories are hierarchical)
- explore words frequencies
